This is a professional portfolio website created to showcase my projects, skills, and experience in web development.

The portfolio includes an introduction, an "About Me" section, a gallery of projects, and a contact form. 
The introduction provides a welcoming overview, while the "About Me" section highlights my background and expertise in web development.

The project gallery showcases several projects, each with its own detailed page that contains a description, key features, technologies used, and download options. 
The individual project pages allow visitors to explore the specifics of each project in more depth, providing an understanding of the tools and approaches used.

The project was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a strong emphasis on responsive design to ensure compatibility across different devices and screen sizes. 
The design incorporates a light blue and orange color scheme, giving the site a clean and professional look. 
Creative elements like hover effects and rotated images are used throughout to add visual interest and enhance user engagement.

The project structure includes an index.html file for the main page, a style.css file for styling, and separate HTML files for each project page to provide detailed views. 
Additionally, there is an images folder containing logos, project thumbnails, and icons.

The project was organized with a focus on code readability, responsive layouts, and user-friendly navigation. 
All files are organized logically, with meaningful names for ease of maintenance and clarity. 
This structure ensures that the portfolio is both easy to navigate for users and simple to update or expand as needed.
